            <h2>Contemporary</h2>
            <p>Contemporary dance is a highly complicated type of modern performance dance that originated in the mid-20th century as an alternative to classical dance styles (such as ballet), modern styles (free dance) and Jazz dance. Its focus on free leg movement, strong stress on the torso, disordered choreography, unpredictability, multiple and simultaneous actions, improvisation, and non-standardized costumes, sets, and lighting has pushed this dance into the forefront of modern art dance scene</p>

                <h1>Let's Groove</h1>
            <p>My love of dance probably stems from a love of music - I have a very broad taste in music and I enjoy it when I am able to partner a favourite style of dance with a favourite song.
            When I dance I am completely released from the preoccupations and stresses of day to day life.
            For me, dance is a complete escape. From talking to my fellow dancers in the Ballroom Dance Company, I get a sense it is very much the same for them. Dance allows me the freedom to express myself in ways I cannot whilst I am at work or at home.</p>

            <p>Dance is a form of expression that brings people together, allows them to be creative in new ways, and is a fantastic way to escape the stresses and cares of everyday life. 
            We hear the thoughts of some of our students and professional tutors, to find out what they love most about dance, how it makes them feel, and what motivates them to dance in their spare time or as a career.
